      <strong>What are interactive stories?</strong> These are narratives with alternative branches at different points, allowing readers to choose their own path through the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our research explores whether creating these stories in Microsoft PowerPoint can be therapeutic. This platform makes it easy to share interactive stories that would otherwise be difficult to distribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How it works:</strong> Upload your PowerPoint presentation, and our research team will review it. Within a day or two, your story will appear here for others to explore. You can request removal at any time by contacting us.
